  <h2>The Cataract of Lodore</h2>
  <p>...The cataract strong</p>
  <p> Then plunges along,</p>
  <p>Striking and raging</p>
</section>
<section class="block2">
  <p>As if a war waging Its caverns and rocks among;</p>
  <p> Rising and leaping, Sinking and creeping,</p>
  <p> Swelling and sweeping, Showering and springing,</p>
</section>
<section class="block3">
  <p> Flying and flinging, Writhing and ringing, </p>
  <p>Eddying and whisking, Spouting and frisking,</p>
  <p> Turning and twisting,</p> 
  
</section>
<section class="block4">
  <p id="one">Around and around With endless rebound:</p><br>
  <p id="two"> Smiting and fighting, A sight to delight in;</p>
  <p id="three"> Confounding, astounding, Dizzying and deafening</p>
  <p id="four"> the ear with its sound.</p>
